# GROUP-12---ENROLLMENT-SYSTEM

Enrollment Form 

Project Description

Overview
This remote enrollment form project aims to simplify 
the enrollment process for students and their families,
eliminating the need for long lines at school. By transitioning
to an online format, we enhance convenience and accessibility 
for all enrollees.

Setup

For this project, we utilize XAMPP,
 which includes PHP and MySQL, 
to efficiently collect and manage 
enrollment data. This setup allows us to create
 a robust and user-friendly platform for gathering 
essential information from students and their guardians.
