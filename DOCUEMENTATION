Enrollment system

Overview

We have faced several challenges with our system,
particularly on the form page. These issues have
prompted us to carefully consider the best programming 
tools to use for our project.

Choice of Technology

After evaluating various options, we decided to use 
XAMPP due to its built-in features that facilitate
local development. XAMPP provides a comprehensive 
environment that includes the Apache server, MySQL database, 
and PHP interpreter, making it an ideal choice for our needs.

Coding Difficulties
In addition to the challenges with the form page, 
we encountered various coding issues. However, we managed to
overcome these obstacles by utilizing PHP for the backend, 
which effectively supports the frontend of our third page. 
This combination allows us to create a seamless user experience 
while ensuring that the data processing is efficient and reliable.

By addressing these challenges head-on and leveraging the
capabilities of XAMPP and PHP, we are working towards a more 
robust and functional enrollment system.
